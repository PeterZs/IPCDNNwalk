# Fast and Flexible Multilegged Locomotion Using Learned Centroidal Dynamics


Target platform
=
Linux and MacOS.

How to build (Linux)
=

  1. First, install necessary dependencies. This probably installs more than actually necessary:
```
  sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 libeigen3-dev libsuitesparse-dev libfontconfig-dev libfltk1.1-dev libdevil-dev libfreeimage-dev liblua5.1-dev  lua5.1 cmake g++ libxml2-dev libncurses5-dev libois-dev libboost-all-dev libf2c2-dev libogre-1.9-dev
```
  
  2. Install the system-provided ogre library to /usr/lib/OGRE:
```
  sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/OGRE-1.9.0 /usr/lib/OGRE 
```

  3. Install more dependencies (after reading src/Makefile carefully):
```
  cd src; make install_dependencies
```

  4. Now, build it.
```
  cd src; make
```

  This should work on ubuntu 18 and 20.
  If this does not work, please remove the system-provided libogre-1.9-dev, and install ogre3D-1.12 from source (see below), and retry the above steps (2-).
	(There are a few linux distros that provide libogre-1.9-dev which is broken.)

How to build (Mac)
=
  1. First, install necessary dependencies:
```
  brew install fltk eigen gsl cmake lua@5.1
  pip3 install wxPython
  (intel mac)
  cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s lua5.1 lua
  (m1 mac)
	ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/lua5.1 /opt/homebrew/bin/lua
```

  2. Then, build Ogre 13.4 or Ogre 1.12 from sources (see below).

  3. Install more dependencies (after reading src/Makefile carefully):
```
  cd src; make install_dependencies_mac
```

  4. Now, build it.
```
  cd src; make mac
```
  FYI, most linker and compiler settings are in src/taesoolib/Samples/Common_baselib.cmake and Common_mainlib.cmake files.

How to run
= 
```
  pip3 install torch python3-tk gym
  cd work; python3 test_walk2.py gym_walkCDM/testWalkV2_FA.lua
```
   Choose the opengl renderer if asked to choose one.
   Now, click the play button, and adjust the slider bars for speed/orientation. Also, you can change the motion type by clicking the button.

How to build ogre 3D from source codes (Linux)
=
```
  sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev nvidia-cg-toolkit libsdl2-dev doxygen
  mkdir -p build;cd build; cmake ..
  cd build;make
  cd build; sudo make install
```

How to build ogre 3D from source codes (Mac)
=
```
  brew install cmake sdl2 doxygen freeimage pkgconfig libzzip
  mkdir -p build;cd build; cmake -G Xcode .. 
  cd build; xed .
```


 1. Build "build-all" in the xcode after manually selecting the release build target. 
 2. Build "install" in the xcode again after manually selecting the release build target. 
 3. Now open a finder, and copy build/sdk to /Applications/OgreSDK
 4. Also, manually copy all frameworks in build/lib/macosx/Release/ to ~/Library/Frameworks/
 5. Copy build/sdk/include/OGRE to /usr/local/include/
 6. Install ois manually (https://github.com/wgois/OIS)

```
  git clone https://github.com/wgois/OIS.git
  cd OIS;cmake -H. -B./build; cd ./build; make; make install
  sudo cp build/Dependencies/lib/libzzip.so* /usr/local/lib/
```
 7. copy libfreetype*.dylib to /usr/local/lib
